react-ts
==========


Getting Started
---------------

This app includes a simple React SPA implementation.

Here are some tools and technologies involved;

* NodeJS Runtime
* Typescript // superset JS language compiled to ES5
* React Scripts // commandline interface and building resources
* ReactMD // Material component suite for ReactJs

#### Development Environment

The implementation requires [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org/) runtime configuration with WebpackJs involved through React Scripts, so
you may want to download and install NodeJS on your local if you don't have it handy. When node and npm (this comes with node installation) are ready;

    ~$ npm install

We should have all packages loaded here. And let's clean, build and run the development environment;

    ~$ npm start

Now, application should be served under *http://localhost:3000/*
